            <p>I found learning web development to initially be a smooth process. This is because I was familiar with
                basic HTML and CSS concepts I learnt in my college course last year, and I was used to programming so a
                lot of the concepts in coding for this project made sense to me easily. However, I found debugging my
                website to be a bit tricky because whenever there is a problem in HTML or CSS code, instead of an actual
                error, the website just won't look as intended, and this I found difficult to work around. Aditionally,
                I found designing the website to be a bit tricky as I needed to look for inspiration from pre-existing
                portfolio websites, but I eventually managed to settle down on an idea that I think worked successfully.
                Some positives aspects of the assignment was how I learnt current HTML and CSS standards of how to and
                not how to design a website. For example, I learnt what semantic tags are, deprecated tags such as
                frame, etc. I also enjoyed implementing the home page with the profile picture's effects and working
                with animations, and I think they went well. What didn't go so well however was working out how to
                implement elements and CSS correctly. Getting the positioning of elements correct was quite difficult,
                especially for the footer, but I was able to persevere and correctly implement everything. </p>

            <p>I think the module went well. I found it really useful to have a refresher on my past web development
                knowledge and have new topics introduced in an engaging way in class. Following the exercises was useful
                because I was able to then take that content and insert it into my website, and when a topic was taught
                that I was already famililar with, I felt like I was ready to jump straight into that part of the
                project with that new knowledge. However, I felt that the lecture explaining Github would have been more
                helpful if it was more of as a "do alongside the presentation" lecture. I struggled with organising my
                time surrounding the module, and I know I could've made a website with more detail if I structured my
                time better earlier on.</p>

            <p>Early on, I decided to use a more minimalistic design for my website, and this was to make it appear more
                professional, simple, and be true to myself for prospective employers to see. Using a mix of three
                colours - purple, white, and black (for the hamburger menu functionality) - helped to achieve this. The
                typeface, Montserrat, was chosen as the sole font of the website to enchance the professionalism and
                simplicity as well. Each page layout was also designed to serve the purpose of the pages' functionality,
                with the index page designed to introduce myself at a quick glance, the projects page desgined in a grid
                format to list out all of my projects, and the rest of the pages have its content stacked upon eachother
                as they did not need a specific type of organising to display the information to the user.</p>

            <p>Below are two website designs that have influenced my website design choices.</p>
